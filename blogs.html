      <p>Benjamin Franklin famously wrote, “either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.” I started a blog to share some of my experiences and ideas while encouraging (maybe forcing) myself to keep contributing. I’m proud to present my very first blog; this one is dedicated to data science. Down the line I hope to try out new blogs focused on some of my other interests in culture, music, and psychology. Stay tuned for more!</p> <h1><a class='link-ds' href="data_science_blog.html">Insights and Interests: (Data Science Blog)</a></h1>
