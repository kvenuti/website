        <p class="blog-content">I was proud to implement my first, solo, neural network over the summer. I’ve been enjoying Udacity’s free online course on <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730" class="post-link" target = '_blank'>Deep Learning</a>. The class is taught in Python, and the nets are implemented in TensorFlow. With intuitive lectures and with some helpful, provided, code, instructors cover NNs, CNNS, and LSTM models. To teach, they primarily use the NotMINST numeric picture dataset. There’s strong forum support and some very clever/pythonic students. The class is an intermediate difficulty, and it helps to have some prior logistic regression and classification. Having started implementation of the CNNs, I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning more about the algorithms driving innovation in AI and computer vision.</p>

        <p class="blog-content">There's a link to this project's poster on my <a href="projects.html" class="post-link" target = '_blank'>Project Page</a>, but I felt that the paper itself should be hosted here. In my Senior Spring, I took a class taught by Dr. Latanya Sweeney: head of the data privacy lab with years of experience in governmental technology and innovation. For our final project, we had the opportunity to investigate the effects and general availability of data. Using meta-data on crime, broken out state by state, I found significant clusters of states based on similar criminal activity.</p>

        <h2 class="date">March 17th 2017</h2>
        <p class="blog-content">March might be over, but the madness of sports analysis never ends! Nearly 20 million NCAA March Madness brackets were made in 2017; has yours busted yet? It seems like every year some no-name high seed upsets a lower seeded team in a marvelous display of determination and grit. Given the immense amount of sports data collected on college basketball, predicting tournament winners is a data scientist’s sweetest of dreams. In fact, every year, Kaggle hosts an NCAA March Madness Bracket prediction competition <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-machine-learning-mania-2016" class="post-link" target = '_blank'>(click here to check it out)</a>. For my final project of Harvard’s CS109A (Intro Datasciecne), I worked with a team to predict which college teams would win in a head to head March Madness matchup.

        <h1 class="blog-title">Why Data Science?</h1>
        <h2 class="date">April 12th 2017</h2>
        <p class="blog-content">I still remember when I made my first linear regression model. We we’re assigned the task of constructing a univarte least squares regression to predict age from demographical attributes. My model was 100 times slower than the equivalent SKlearn function and used an excessive amount of code and memory. Regardless, I was mesmerized by the ability to predict the future solely using prior events.  Soon after, on the same problem set, I constructed my first classification model using a k-nearest neighbors algorithm. I’m too embarrassed to mention how slow it was; but plotting the data using my predicted classes and comparing accuracy to the true classes made up for the frustrating hour I spent debugging such a simple, in hindsight, model. I was hooked. From there, the world of predictive analytics was opened through visualization techniques and statistical and machine learning. I started this blog to further my data science education and get feedback on my projects.</p>
